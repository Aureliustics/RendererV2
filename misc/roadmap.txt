Todo:
- VSync or just an fps limiter to test if delta time works
- Dynamic window size
- Prompt for window size (with PYSDL2 messagebox)
- Modularize render components to work with more than 1 file. (Will probably have a game.py file)
- Implement texture system (with a texture atlas prob)
- Implement polygons and coloured faces
- Implement shading
- Implement .j3d files to easily store and load 3d models in game
- Update .j3d files to include textures and color data (as it currently just ignores that)
