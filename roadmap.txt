Todo:
- Delta time for consistent movement speed
- Dynamic window size
- Prompt for window size (with PYSDL2 messagebox)
- Modularize render components to work with more than 1 file. (Will probably have a game.py file)
- Implement texture system (with a texture atlas prob)
- Implement polygons and coloured faces
- Implement shading
